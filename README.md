Collection of code modifications to Dark Souls III - Inspired by "Chaos Randomisers", notably versions for Super Mario 64.
The LUA in this project is going to be somewhat *not great*, so I request: no bully ;w;.


This mod requires a memory editor to be used - The attached .CT file is made for use with DarkByte's Cheat Engine, as it uses CE LUA and CE ASM.
